This plugin creates a javascript widget in your sidebar that shows ads to your site visitors based on what country they're in. 

== Description ==

This plugin creates a javascript widget that shows ads in your sidebar based on what country each visitor is from.  It uses the MaxMind GeoIP JS Web Service to do this.

MaxMind's API is extremely fast, lightweight, and most of all, free.

Since it's all Javascript, it *should* be compatible with caching plugins like W3 Total Cache and WP Super Cache (needs testing).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does WP GeoLocation work all the time? =
According to MaxMind.com, their geolocation service is online 99.95% of the time.

= Does WP GeoLocation always display info accurately? =
No. If your visitor is using a proxy, then their actual geolocation info will be incorrect.

= How accurate is the geolocation information? =
Pretty accurate. This plugin accesses MaxMind's server to get geolocation data, so it's usually on target.
However, if your visitor is from a small town, their location may resolve to the nearest large metro area.

= What are the disadvantages of using the JavaScript service? =
The main disadvantage is that the information is saved to JavaScript variables as opposed to PHP variables.
This means that you can't have wordpress act differently with post content until the page is loaded.

The updside is that the JavaScript service is far more accurate than the free GeoIP database that is offered.
